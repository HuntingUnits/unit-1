    "description": "Wyoming Elk Unit 110 and Deer Unit 78 is a great unit for multiple tag draws. Hunting for bull elk is open for general licenses, but is a limited quota for cow/calf harvest. Hunters with at least four preference points will have a good chance at drawing a cow/calf tag. This unit also has great mule deer and whitetail deer hunting opportunities. Mule deer harvests are limited to buck only and are a limited quota hunt. Whitetail deer are also limited quota hunts, but have better odds for tags than mule deer. Just over half of these units are public lands with two sections requiring guides for non-resident hunters.",
